# Command Processing Workflow Implementation

This document describes the complete command processing workflow implementation for the mira-assistant/backend that integrates with AI models hosted on LM Studio.

## Architecture Overview

The implementation consists of several key components working together:

```
Audio Input → Wake Word Detection → AI Model Analysis → Callback Execution → User Response
     ↓              ↓                      ↓                    ↓              ↓
Transcription  Wake Word Found    Function Determination   Backend Action   Frontend
```

## Core Components

### 1. Command Workflow Module (`command_workflow.py`)

**CallbackRegistry**
- Manages available callback functions
- Supports registration, execution, and configuration
- Auto-extracts function parameters using introspection
- Provides enable/disable functionality

**CommandProcessor**
- Orchestrates the complete workflow
- Communicates with AI model for callback determination
- Executes callbacks and generates user responses
- Handles errors and fallback scenarios

### 2. Integration Points

**Wake Word Detection** (`command_processor.py`)
- Existing wake word detector triggers command processing
- Supports multiple wake words with configurable sensitivity
- Integrates seamlessly with new workflow

**AI Model Communication** (`inference_processor.py`)
- Enhanced system prompts include available function lists
- Structured JSON responses for callback determination
- Uses existing LM Studio integration

**API Endpoints** (`mira.py`)
- Automatic command processing on wake word detection
- Command results included in interaction responses
- New endpoints for monitoring and configuration

## Available Callback Functions

### Default Functions

1. **getTime()** - Returns current time
2. **getWeather(location)** - Returns weather information for specified location
3. **disableMira()** - Disables the Mira assistant service

### Custom Functions

Functions can be dynamically registered:

```python
from command_workflow import get_command_processor

processor = get_command_processor()
processor.callback_registry.register(
    name="customFunction",
    function=my_function,
    description="What this function does"
)
```

## API Endpoints

### Existing Endpoints (Enhanced)

**POST `/interactions/register`**
- Now includes command processing when wake words detected
- Returns command results in response structure:
```json
{
  "id": "interaction-id",
  "text": "Hey Mira, what time is it?",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "speaker_id": "speaker-id",
  "command_result": {
    "callback_executed": true,
    "callback_name": "getTime",
    "user_response": "The current time is 2:30 PM",
    "error": null
  }
}
```

### New Endpoints

**GET `/commands/last-result`**
- Returns the last command processing result
- Useful for monitoring and debugging

**GET `/commands/callbacks`**
- Returns list of available callback functions
- Includes function descriptions for AI model prompts

## Workflow Details

### 1. Wake Word Detection
When audio is processed and a wake word is detected:
- The full transcribed text is analyzed
- Command processing is automatically triggered
- Wake word confidence affects processing

### 2. AI Model Analysis
The AI model receives:
- User's complete transcribed text
- List of available callback functions
- Function descriptions and parameters
- System prompt with examples

The AI responds with:
```json
{
  "callback_function": "functionName" | null,
  "callback_arguments": {"arg1": "value1"},
  "user_response": "What to say to the user"
}
```

### 3. Callback Execution
- Backend validates function exists and is enabled
- Executes function with provided arguments
- Captures results and errors
- Generates appropriate user response

### 4. Response Generation
- Combines AI response with callback results
- Provides structured data to frontend
- Includes error handling and fallback messages

## Configuration

### Wake Words
Default wake words include:
- "hey mira"
- "okay mira"
- "mira" 
- "listen mira"
- "start recording"

### AI Model Settings
- Model: Configurable in `inference_processor.py`
- Temperature: 0.3 (for consistent responses)
- Max tokens: -1 (no limit)
- System prompts dynamically generated with available functions

## Error Handling

### Fallback Mechanisms
1. **No AI Response**: "I didn't understand that command"
2. **Function Not Found**: "Sorry, I couldn't execute that command"
3. **Function Error**: Specific error message with fallback
4. **No Wake Word**: Normal processing without command execution

### Monitoring
- All command results logged
- Last result available via API
- Error tracking and reporting

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Complete test coverage for all components
- Mock dependencies for CI/CD compatibility
- Parameterized tests for various scenarios

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint testing
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Error scenario testing

## Usage Examples

### Basic Command
```
User: "Hey Mira, what time is it?"
→ Wake word detected: "hey mira"
→ AI determines: getTime() 
→ Backend executes: "The current time is 2:30 PM"
→ Frontend receives structured response
```

### Command with Arguments
```
User: "Hey Mira, what's the weather in San Francisco?"
→ Wake word detected: "hey mira"
→ AI determines: getWeather(location="San Francisco")
→ Backend executes weather lookup
→ Returns weather information
```

### Conversational Response
```
User: "Hey Mira, how are you?"
→ Wake word detected: "hey mira"
→ AI determines: No callback needed
→ Returns conversational response
→ No backend action required
```

## Deployment Notes

### Requirements
- LM Studio running with compatible model
- All existing backend dependencies
- Network access for AI model communication

### Model Selection
Recommended models for LM Studio:
- **Lightweight**: GPT-J, GPT-NeoX (fast command processing)
- **Advanced**: Llama 2, Falcon (nuanced understanding)
- **Balanced**: Mistral 7B (good performance/speed ratio)

### Performance Considerations
- Command processing adds ~100-200ms to wake word interactions
- AI model response time depends on model size and hardware
- Callback execution time varies by function complexity

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Context Awareness**: Use conversation history for better command understanding
2. **Multi-step Commands**: Support for complex, multi-part commands
3. **Voice Confirmation**: Audio confirmation for critical commands
4. **Custom Model Fine-tuning**: Optimize AI model for specific command patterns
5. **Callback Chaining**: Allow callbacks to trigger other callbacks

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Smart Home**: IoT device control callbacks
2. **Calendar Integration**: Meeting scheduling and reminders
3. **Communication**: Email, messaging, and calling functions
4. **Information Retrieval**: Web search, knowledge base queries
5. **System Control**: Device settings and configuration

## Security Considerations

### Function Registration
- Only trusted code should register callbacks
- Function validation and sandboxing recommended
- Parameter sanitization for external data

### AI Model Security
- Validate AI responses before execution
- Limit callback execution scope
- Monitor for malicious command attempts

### Data Privacy
- Command processing logs may contain sensitive information
- Consider data retention policies
- Secure communication with AI model
